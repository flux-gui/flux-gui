# Community and Governance

Flux GUI is a community-driven fork of the original Weave GitOps project. This document describes how the project is currently organized, how to contribute, and where to get help.

## Purpose

This fork preserves the original functionality while providing a place for the community to evolve the UI and integrations under the Flux GUI name. We aim to keep the project open, welcoming, and transparent.

## Code of conduct

All contributors must follow the project's code of conduct: see `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.

## License and DCO

This project is licensed under the Apache-2.0 license (see `LICENSE`).
By submitting contributions you agree to the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) -- see `CONTRIBUTING.md` for details.

## Governance

At present the project follows a lightweight, meritocratic model:

- Maintainers: a small group of volunteers who review and merge PRs and make releases.
- Contributors: anyone who opens issues, files PRs, or improves documentation.

Maintainers are documented in the `MAINTAINERS` file. If you want to become a maintainer, open an issue describing your involvement and proposed responsibilities.

## How to contribute

1. Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the development guide in `doc/development-process.md`.
2. Open an issue to discuss larger changes before starting work.
3. Create a branch, make small focused commits, and open a pull request. Follow the Conventional Commits format as described in the repository.
4. Add tests for new functionality when applicable.

PRs should include a clear description and tests where appropriate. Contributors should be prepared to iterate on a PR per reviewer feedback.

## Communication channels

- GitHub Issues and Discussions: primary place for design, planning, and support.
- PRs: for code changes and reviews.

## Releases

Releases will be performed from the repository's default branch. Release notes are generated from Conventional Commit titles.

## Security

If you discover a security issue, please follow the process described in `SECURITY.md`.

## Other notes

This project is community maintained. If you'd like to help with documentation, triage, coding, or maintenance, please open an issue and state how you would like to help.
